# Path Sum



### 112. Path Sum\[E\]

[https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/)

#### Description

Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

Given the below binary tree and `sum = 22`,

```text
      5
     / \
    4   8
   /   / \
  11  13  4
 /  \      \
7    2      1
```

return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path `5->4->11->2` which sum is 22.

#### Solution

### 113. Path Sum II\[M\]

[https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-ii/](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-ii/)

#### Description

Given a binary tree and a sum, find all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals the given sum.

**Note:** A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

Given the below binary tree and `sum = 22`,

```text
      5
     / \
    4   8
   /   / \
  11  13  4
 /  \    / \
7    2  5   1
```

Return:

```text
[
   [5,4,11,2],
   [5,8,4,5]
]
```

#### Solution

```python

```

### 437. Path Sum III\[M\]

[https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-iii/](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum-iii/)

#### Description

You are given a binary tree in which each node contains an integer value.

Find the number of paths that sum to a given value.

The path does not need to start or end at the root or a leaf, but it must go downwards \(traveling only from parent nodes to child nodes\).

The tree has no more than 1,000 nodes and the values are in the range -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.

**Example:**

```text
root = [10,5,-3,3,2,null,11,3,-2,null,1], sum = 8

      10
     /  \
    5   -3
   / \    \
  3   2   11
 / \   \
3  -2   1

Return 3. The paths that sum to 8 are:

1.  5 -> 3
2.  5 -> 2 -> 1
3. -3 -> 11
```

#### Solution

```python

```
