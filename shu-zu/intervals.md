# Intervals



### 56. Merge Intervals\[M\]

[https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)

#### Description

Given a collection of intervals, merge all overlapping intervals.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: [[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] overlaps, merge them into [1,6].
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: [[1,4],[4,5]]
Output: [[1,5]]
Explanation: Intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are considered overlapping.
```

#### Solution

```python

```

### 57. Insert Interval\[H\]

[https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-interval/)

#### Description

Given a set of _non-overlapping_ intervals, insert a new interval into the intervals \(merge if necessary\).

You may assume that the intervals were initially sorted according to their start times.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[6,9]], newInterval = [2,5]
Output: [[1,5],[6,9]]
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[3,5],[6,7],[8,10],[12,16]], newInterval = [4,8]
Output: [[1,2],[3,10],[12,16]]
Explanation: Because the new interval [4,8] overlaps with [3,5],[6,7],[8,10].
```
