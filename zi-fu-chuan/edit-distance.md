# Edit Distance



### 72. Edit Distance\[H\]

[https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/](https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/)

#### Description

Given two words _word1_ and _word2_, find the minimum number of operations required to convert _word1_ to _word2_.

You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:

1. Insert a character
2. Delete a character
3. Replace a character

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
Output: 3
Explanation: 
horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
rose -> ros (remove 'e')
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
Output: 5
Explanation: 
intention -> inention (remove 't')
inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
exection -> execution (insert 'u')
```

#### Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLastWord(self, s: str) -> int:
        ss = s.rstrip().split(" ")
        return len(ss[len(ss)-1])
```
