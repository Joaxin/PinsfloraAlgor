# Isomorphic Strings



### 205. Isomorphic Strings\[E\]

[https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/](https://leetcode.com/problems/isomorphic-strings/)

#### Description

Given two strings _**s\**_ and _**t\**_, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in _**s\**_ can be replaced to get _**t\**_.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**

```text
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
```

**Note:** You may assume both _**s\**_ and _**t\**_ have the same length.

#### Solution

```python

```
